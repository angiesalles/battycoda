# Default species definitions for BattyCoda
# This file previously contained definitions of system-wide species, but they are now
# created through migrations and don't need to be defined here.
# The system-wide species are:
# - Eptesicus fuscus
# - Carollia perspicillata
#
# Saccopteryx bilineata is created for each user's group in import_default_species
# function and is not defined here either.
