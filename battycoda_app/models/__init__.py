BattyCoda Models Package

This package contains all the application models organized into logical modules:
- user.py: User profiles, groups, and authentication models
- organization.py: Projects, species, and organizational models
- recording.py: Recording, segments, and segmentation models
- task.py: Task and task batch models
- classification.py: Detection and classification models
- notification.py: User notification models
- clustering.py: Unsupervised clustering models

IMPORTANT: Email Uniqueness Constraint
The built-in Django User model does not enforce email uniqueness by default.
A database-level unique constraint has been added to the auth_user.email field
via migration 0014_auto_20250716_1838.py to prevent duplicate email addresses.
All code that queries users by email should handle the uniqueness properly.
